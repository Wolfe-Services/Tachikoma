# Spec 001: Getting Started

**Status:** Ready  
**Priority:** P0 - Critical

## Your First Tachikoma Mission

Welcome, Major! This spec will help you get familiar with Tachikoma's workflow.

Tachikoma is an AI agent development framework that reads specs like this one and implements them automatically. You write the requirements, Tachikoma writes the code.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Read this spec completely
- [ ] Run `tachikoma run --spec 001` to let Tachikoma implement something simple
- [ ] Watch the loop execute and learn the pattern
- [ ] Create your first custom spec with `tachikoma chat`

## What Happens Next

When you run `tachikoma run`, Tachikoma will:

1. **Read** this spec file
2. **Understand** the acceptance criteria  
3. **Execute** tasks to complete each criterion
4. **Mark** checkboxes as it goes: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
5. **Commit** changes when done

This is the core Tachikoma loop: **Read → Plan → Code → Test → Commit**.

## Your Turn

After completing this spec:

1. **Explore** the generated code and commit
2. **Run** `tachikoma chat` to brainstorm new features
3. **Create** specs for real projects
4. **Let Tachikoma** handle the implementation

## Pro Tips

- Write clear, specific acceptance criteria
- Include testing requirements in your specs
- Start small and build incrementally
- Use `tachikoma doctor` if you run into issues

Happy coding! 🕷️

## Implementation Notes

This is a learning spec - Tachikoma will simply mark the checkboxes and help you understand the workflow. No actual code needs to be written here.
