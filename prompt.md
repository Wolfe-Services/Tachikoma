# Current Mission

Study `specs/README.md` to understand the project structure and find the current spec to implement.

Then study the spec file indicated below and implement it according to its requirements.

## Active Spec
<!-- Replace with current spec path -->
specs/phase-00-setup/001-project-structure.md

## Instructions

1. Read the spec file completely
2. Follow all acceptance criteria
3. Implement the code according to the patterns specified
4. Run tests if applicable
5. Update the implementation plan checkbox when complete
6. Commit changes with a clear message

## Constraints

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use the tachikoma-web i18n patterns for TypeScript
- Use the tachikoma-i18n patterns for Rust
- Author property-based tests or unit tests (whichever is best)
- After making changes, run the tests
- When tests pass, commit and push to deploy

## On Completion

Mark the task complete in the spec's implementation plan and move to the next unchecked item.
